Audience: Operators setting up and running agents in Paperclip

## 1. What this system does

Agents in Paperclip do not run continuously.  
They run in **heartbeats**: short execution windows triggered by a wakeup.

Each heartbeat:

1. Starts the configured agent adapter (for example, Claude CLI or Codex CLI)
2. Gives it the current prompt/context
3. Lets it work until it exits, times out, or is cancelled
4. Stores results (status, token usage, errors, logs)
5. Updates the UI live

## 2. When an agent wakes up

An agent can be woken up in four ways:

- `timer`: scheduled interval (for example every 5 minutes)
- `assignment`: when work is assigned/checked out to that agent
- `on_demand`: manual wakeup (button/API)
- `automation`: system-triggered wakeup for future automations

If an agent is already running, new wakeups are merged (coalesced) instead of launching duplicate runs.

## 3. What to configure per agent

## 3.1 Adapter choice

Common choices:

- `claude_local`: runs your local `claude` CLI
- `codex_local`: runs your local `codex` CLI
- `process`: generic shell command adapter
- `http`: calls an external HTTP endpoint

For `claude_local` and `codex_local`, Paperclip assumes the CLI is already installed and authenticated on the host machine.

## 3.2 Runtime behavior

In agent runtime settings, configure heartbeat policy:

- `enabled`: allow scheduled heartbeats
- `intervalSec`: timer interval (0 = disabled)
- `wakeOnAssignment`: wake when assigned work
- `wakeOnOnDemand`: allow ping-style on-demand wakeups
- `wakeOnAutomation`: allow system automation wakeups

## 3.3 Working directory and execution limits

For local adapters, set:

- `cwd` (working directory)
- `timeoutSec` (max runtime per heartbeat)
- `graceSec` (time before force-kill after timeout/cancel)
- optional env vars and extra CLI args
- use **Test environment** in agent configuration to run adapter-specific diagnostics
