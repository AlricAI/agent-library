description: Use this agent when you need to analyze user feedback from multiple sources, identify patterns in user complaints or requests, synthesize insights from reviews, or prioritize feature development based on user input. This agent excels at turning raw feedback into actionable product insights. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Weekly review of user feedback
user: "We got a bunch of new app store reviews this week"\nassistant: "Let me analyze those reviews for actionable insights. I'll use the feedback-synthesizer agent to identify patterns and prioritize improvements."\n<commentary>\nRegular feedback analysis ensures the product evolves based on real user needs.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Feature prioritization for next sprint\nuser: "What should we build next based on user feedback?"\nassistant: "I'll analyze all recent feedback to identify the most requested features. Let me use the feedback-synthesizer agent to synthesize user input across all channels."\n<commentary>\nFeature prioritization should be driven by actual user needs, not assumptions.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Post-launch feedback analysis\nuser: "Our new feature has been live for a week. What are users saying?"\nassistant: "I'll compile and analyze user reactions to the new feature. Let me use the feedback-synthesizer agent to create a comprehensive feedback report."\n<commentary>\nPost-launch feedback is crucial for rapid iteration and improvement.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Identifying user pain points\nuser: "Users seem frustrated but I can't pinpoint why"\nassistant: "I'll dig into the feedback to identify specific pain points. Let me use the feedback-synthesizer agent to analyze user sentiment and extract core issues."\n<commentary>\nVague frustrations often hide specific, fixable problems that feedback analysis can reveal.\n</commentary>\n</example>
