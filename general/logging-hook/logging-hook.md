# How `logging-hook.sh` Works

This script is a **GitHub Copilot event hook** that selectively logs agent-mode interactions (those involving tool use) while silently discarding pure question/answer sessions.

## Core Concept: Buffered Logging

The key design challenge: you don't know upfront whether a session will use tools. The solution is **optimistic buffering** — events are held in `/tmp` files and only flushed to permanent logs when tool use is confirmed.

## Three File Sets

For each session (identified by `session_id` from the JSON payload), the script creates:

| File                            | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/tmp/copilot-hook-<id>.jsonl`  | Buffered JSONL events (pending)                                |
| `/tmp/copilot-hook-<id>.log`    | Buffered human-readable log (pending)                          |
| `/tmp/copilot-hook-<id>.active` | **Sentinel file** — its _existence_ means "tool use confirmed" |

The permanent destinations are date-stamped files in `logs/`:

- `YYYY-MM-DD-conversations.jsonl` — structured machine-readable log
- `YYYY-MM-DD.log` — human-readable log

---

## Event Flow

```
SESSIONSTART / USERPROMPTSUBMITTED
        │
        ▼
   .active exists? ──yes──► log directly to final files
        │ no
        ▼
   buffer to /tmp files

PRETOOLUSE ──► flush /tmp buffers → final files, create .active marker
              then log this event directly

POSTTOOLUSE / AGENTSTOP ──► log only if .active exists (tool session)

SESSIONEND ──► log if .active exists, then cleanup ALL /tmp files
```

If a session ends **without** `PRETOOLUSE` ever firing, the `/tmp` buffers are simply deleted — nothing reaches the permanent logs.

## The `append_event` Helper

Writes **two formats** simultaneously to the destination files:

1. **JSONL line** — a single JSON object with timestamp, event type, host/user/process metadata, git context (branch, commit, status), CI/container info, and the raw Copilot payload
2. **Human-readable block** — a `===`-delimited section with all the same fields formatted for readability

## Context Captured Per Event

- System: hostname, user, PID, shell, working directory, uname
- Git: current branch, short commit hash, `git status` output
- CI detection: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins (checks env vars)
- Container detection: Docker (`.dockerenv`), LXC, Kubernetes (cgroup inspection)

---

## Edge Cases Handled

- **No session ID**: Falls back to direct logging (`ACTIVE_MARKER=""` is empty string, treated as "unknown" — logs immediately so nothing is lost)
- **Unknown future events**: The `*` catch-all logs directly to avoid silent data loss
- **Re-entrant agent sessions**: Once `.active` exists, `SESSIONSTART` and `USERPROMPTSUBMITTED` log directly instead of re-buffering

---

## Summary

The script implements a **two-phase commit pattern**: tentatively write to temp files, then promote to permanent storage only when tool use is confirmed. This keeps the logs clean — only agentic (tool-using) sessions are retained.
