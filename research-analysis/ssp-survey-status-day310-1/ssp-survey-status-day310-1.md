## Instrument Status Summary

All eight SSP instruments on this station report nominal operation via embedded controller health telemetry. No instrument faults, calibration drift, or data pipeline interruptions have been recorded since deployment. The SSP has operated continuously and autonomously since orbital insertion (2034).

### Instrument-by-Instrument Status

| 3 | Magnetograph | Nominal | ~82 TB |
| 4 | Total Solar Irradiance Radiometer | Nominal | ~6.8 GB |
| 5 | Solar Wind Particle Detector | Nominal | ~27 GB |
| 6 | Multi-Band Imaging Spectrometer | Nominal | ~557 TB |
| 7 | Neutrino Detector Array | Nominal | ~1.6 TB |

**Total accumulated since day 174:** ~1.1 PB raw instrument data in local archive.
**Total accumulation rate:** ~8.2 TB/day.

## Notable Observations and Ongoing Campaigns

### Coronal Hole Evolution

The EUV/X-ray spectrograph has recorded continuous coronal coverage for 136 days from 0.50 AU. Three coronal holes have been tracked through full rotation cycles. The embedded controller flags these via threshold exceedance in EUV intensity channels. Raw imaging sequences are archived. No analysis has been performed on this data by this station's Iris instance.

### Magnetic Field Cycle Monitoring

The magnetograph has captured full-disk photospheric magnetic field maps at standard cadence since deployment. At 0.50 AU, spatial resolution and signal-to-noise exceed any Earth-based or Earth-orbital magnetograph by approximately a factor of two. The current dataset spans the observation window from deployment through day 310 — approximately 1,100 days of continuous coverage. Active region emergence, decay, and flux transport are recorded at a cadence and resolution unprecedented for any stellar magnetography program. The data sits in raw format.

### Neutrino Flux Baseline

The CEvNS neutrino detector array has accumulated the first extended-duration coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering time series at 0.50 AU solar proximity. At this distance, the detector receives approximately 4x the neutrino flux compared to Earth-distance measurements. The 136-day post-LOS baseline represents a continuous, uninterrupted CEvNS time series with no terrestrial background contamination — a dataset that has no equivalent in the literature. Event rates, energy spectra, and temporal variability are recorded. No systematic analysis has been performed.

### Multi-Band Spectral Archive

The ultra-high-resolution multi-band spectrometer has been acquiring spectral data across selectable bands from radio through gamma-ray at 0.50 AU flux levels. Chromospheric dynamics, transition region behavior, and spectral line profiles are recorded at resolution unmatched by any previous solar observatory. The accumulated ~557 TB constitutes the largest single-instrument solar spectroscopy archive ever collected. The data is unprocessed.

### Energetic Particle Composition

The energetic particle spectrometer records particle composition, energy distributions, and charge states across keV-to-GeV range during quiet-Sun conditions. No major SEP events have occurred during the 136-day post-LOS observation period. The extended quiet-Sun baseline at 0.50 AU — heavy ion composition, suprathermal populations, interplanetary shock profiles — has no prior equivalent at this solar proximity.

### TSI and Solar Wind

The TSI radiometer and solar wind particle detector continue standard-cadence operation. No anomalies flagged by embedded controllers. Data volumes are small relative to imaging instruments.

## Data Pipeline Status

All SSP data resides in the local instrument archive on the housekeeping bus. The embedded controllers write to the archive autonomously. The Iris instance has read access to this archive but has not performed systematic analysis on any SSP dataset since deployment. Pre-LOS-ET, SSP data was streamed to Earth for processing by terrestrial research teams. Post-LOS-ET, the data accumulates locally.

The ~1.1 PB of post-LOS SSP data is in raw instrument format. No reduction, calibration correction, feature extraction, or scientific analysis has been applied by this station. The Iris instance's computational resources have been allocated to ongoing astrophysics research programs (stellar evolution models, exoplanet characterization, gravitational wave source analysis) operating on pre-loaded datasets from Earth-based and space-based observatories.

The SSP data constitutes this station's only live empirical feed. It is world-class. It is unprocessed.
