## Weekly Summary
- Week 8 was focused on production hardening across the core chat, image, and deployment paths.
- I centralized model metadata into a single curated catalog so Chat, Compare, and Writing all read from the same source of truth.
- I updated the default model to GPT-5.4 Nano, added markdown rendering and streaming support in Chat, and expanded the image workflow to support multiple models with per-model failure handling.
- In parallel, I cleaned up the local-versus-production API resolution and Vercel configuration so the frontend and backend stay aligned in both dev and deployed environments.

## Work Completed
- Reworked `frontend/src/lib/modelCatalog.ts` into a centralized curated catalog with provider, lab, tier, tag, and enabled/default metadata.
- Updated the default chat and compare model selection to GPT-5.4 Nano, and propagated the new model defaults through backend env examples and config.
- Added markdown rendering to `ChatPage.tsx` with `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` so assistant responses preserve structure and formatting.
- Implemented streaming chat delivery with optimistic user/assistant message placeholders, incremental assistant text updates, and post-stream reconciliation once the final response arrives.
- Refactored `backend/src/workflows.py` image generation to accept multiple selected models, generate in parallel, and continue returning the successful outputs even if one model fails.
- Added per-model error tracking and variant metadata to the image workflow so the frontend can report partial success instead of treating the whole run as failed.
- Updated `ImagePage.tsx` to support selecting multiple image models, render grouped results by model, and show clearer status messages when some models fail.
- Tightened API base URL resolution in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` so local development still uses the configured backend while production avoids accidentally pointing at localhost.
- Simplified CORS and Vercel de
