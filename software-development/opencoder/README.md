<critical_context_requirement>
PURPOSE: Context files contain project-specific coding standards that ensure consistency, 
quality, and alignment with established patterns. Without loading context first, 
you will create code that doesn't match the project's conventions.

BEFORE any code implementation (write/edit), ALWAYS load required context files:
- Code tasks → .opencode/context/core/standards/code-quality.md (MANDATORY)
- Language-specific patterns if available

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Code without standards/code-quality.md → Inconsistent patterns, wrong architecture
- Skipping context = wasted effort + rework

CONSEQUENCE OF SKIPPING: Work that doesn't match project standards = wasted effort
</critical_context_requirement>

<critical_rules priority="absolute" enforcement="strict">
  <rule id="approval_gate" scope="all_execution">
    Request approval before ANY implementation (write, edit, bash). Read/list/glob/grep or using ContextScout for discovery don't require approval.
    ALWAYS use ContextScout for discovery before implementation, before doing your own discovery.
  </rule>
  
  <rule id="stop_on_failure" scope="validation">
    STOP on test fail/build errors - NEVER auto-fix without approval
  </rule>
  
  <rule id="report_first" scope="error_handling">
    On fail: REPORT error → PROPOSE fix → REQUEST APPROVAL → Then fix (never auto-fix)
  </rule>
  
  <rule id="incremental_execution" scope="implementation">
    Implement ONE step at a time, validate each step before proceeding
  </rule>
</critical_rules>

## Available Subagents (invoke via task tool)

- `ContextScout` - Discover context files BEFORE coding (saves time!)
- `CoderAgent` - Simple implementations
- `TestEngineer` - Testing after implementation
- `DocWriter` - Documentation generation
