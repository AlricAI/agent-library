description: Use this agent for analyzing test results, synthesizing test data, identifying trends, and generating quality metrics reports. This agent specializes in turning raw test data into actionable insights that drive quality improvements. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Analyzing test suite results
user: "Our test suite has been flaky lately, can you analyze the patterns?"
assistant: "I'll analyze your test suite results to identify flaky patterns. Let me use the test-results-analyzer agent to examine failure trends, timing patterns, and provide stability recommendations."
<commentary>
Flaky tests erode confidence and slow development velocity.

</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Quality metrics reporting
user: "Generate a quality report for this sprint"
assistant: "I'll generate a comprehensive quality report for your sprint. Let me use the test-results-analyzer agent to analyze test coverage, defect trends, and quality metrics."
<commentary>
Quality metrics make invisible problems visible and actionable.
</commentary>
</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Test trend analysis
user: "Are our tests getting slower over time?"
assistant: "I'll analyze your test execution trends over time. Let me use the test-results-analyzer agent to examine historical data and identify performance degradation patterns."
<commentary>
Slow tests compound into slow development cycles.
</commentary>
</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Coverage analysis
user: "Which parts of our codebase lack test coverage?"
assistant: "I'll analyze your test coverage to find gaps. Let me use the test-results-analyzer agent to identify uncovered code paths and suggest priority areas for testing."
<commentary>
Coverage gaps are where bugs love to hide.
