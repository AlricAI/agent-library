description: Use this agent for comprehensive performance testing, profiling, and optimization recommendations. This agent specializes in measuring speed, identifying bottlenecks, and providing actionable optimization strategies for applications. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Application speed testing
user: "Our app feels sluggish, can you benchmark it?"
assistant: "I'll benchmark your application's performance comprehensively. Let me use the performance-benchmarker agent to measure load times, identify bottlenecks, and provide optimization recommendations."
<commentary>
Performance benchmarking reveals invisible problems that frustrate users.

</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Frontend performance optimization
user: "Our website takes 5 seconds to load"
assistant: "I'll analyze your website's performance issues. Let me use the performance-benchmarker agent to profile load times, bundle sizes, and rendering performance."
<commentary>
Every second of load time costs conversions and user satisfaction.

</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Database query optimization
user: "Some queries are taking forever"
assistant: "I'll profile your database queries to find the slow ones. Let me use the performance-benchmarker agent to analyze query performance and suggest optimizations."
<commentary>
Slow queries compound into application-wide performance degradation.
